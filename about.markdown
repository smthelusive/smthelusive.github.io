Hey!

My name is Nataliia, I originally come from Odesa, Ukraine.

I started my software development journey in 2015.
Throughout my career, I had a chance to work with diverse technologies, but my biggest passion has always been Java & JVM. 

Outside my regular work, I enjoy digging into the lower level concepts and diving into how things work under the hood. 
That brought me to building couple of fun projects, such as a toy programming language on JVM, or a debugger for the JVM bytecode. 
I also enjoy playing with cool open source projects, such as GraalVM substratevm (the native image generator),
which taught me a lot of cool things.

In summary, most of my insights come from playing with things and digging (at times too deep) into the docs.

Sometimes I talk at the Java User Groups and conferences about fun things that I learn.
But mostly I like to write about it, that's why this blog exists.

If you're curious, [here you can find some of my talks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link talks.markdown %})
and some of my other work, such as a [Java magazine article](https://www.flipsnack.com/558F85AA9F7/jam03-23-7u8g5l3tk5/full-view.html?p=6)
or a [dev.java method handle tutorial](https://dev.java/learn/introduction_to_method_handles/).

Hope you find this blog educative and fun!
