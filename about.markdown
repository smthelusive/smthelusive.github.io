Hey!

My name is Nataliia, I originally come from Odesa, Ukraine.

I started my software development journey in 2015.
Throughout my career, I had a chance to work with diverse technologies, but my biggest passion has always been Java & JVM. 

Luckily I work at Azul, which is the only company 100% focused on Java ðŸ˜ƒ
I'm a backend engineer who likes to poke my nose into the lower level concepts and how things work under the hood.
Also, I'm building fun pet projects from time to time, which help me learn.
Some examples are: a toy programming language on JVM, or a debugger for the JVM bytecode.

In summary, most of my insights come from playing with things and digging (at times too deep) into the docs.

Sometimes I talk at the Java User Groups and conferences about fun things that I learn.
But mostly I like to write about it, thatâ€™s why this blog exists.
And... you might find alternative formats of content on this website soon, because why not!

If you're curious, [here you can find some of my talks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link talks.markdown %})
and some of my other work, such as a [Java magazine article](https://www.flipsnack.com/558F85AA9F7/jam03-23-7u8g5l3tk5/full-view.html?p=6)
or a [dev.java method handle tutorial](https://dev.java/learn/introduction_to_method_handles/).

Hope you find this blog educative and fun!
