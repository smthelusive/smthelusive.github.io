Hey!

My name is Nataliia, I originally come from Odesa, Ukraine.

I started my software development journey in 2015.
Throughout my career, I had a chance to work with diverse technologies, but my biggest passion has always been Java & JVM. 

Outside my regular work, I enjoy digging into the lower level concepts and diving into how things work under the hood. 
That brought me to building couple of fun projects, such as a toy programming language on JVM, or a debugger for the JVM bytecode. 
I'm also quite excited about GraalVM, so I worked on a contribution for native image and learned a lot during the process.

Sometimes, I talk at the Java User Groups and conferences about fun things that I learn.
But mostly I like to write about it, that's why this blog exists.

If you're curious, [here you can find some of my talks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link talks.markdown %}).

And some of my other work:

Hope you find this blog educative and fun!
