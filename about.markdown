Hello!

My name is Nataliia, I come from Odesa, Ukraine (it's a beautiful city, worth visiting!).\
\
My software development journey led me through couple of countries, so I have lived and worked in Ukraine, Poland and the Netherlands.\
\
I've started in 2015 as an Oracle/Java developer (a lot of PL/SQL related stuff), probably that's why since then I'm so passionate about the databases.\
Later I have worked (and continue doing so) with some Java and Scala projects. And yes, I'm one of those, who has worked with Scala and still kept loving Java. ðŸ˜€\
Besides, I like automating everything.\
\
I've started this blog, because there are always things in normal routine of development, that are worth sharing. 
There is always something interesting going on, even if you're chasing a silly bug for the whole day. This experience may be actually helpful for somebody.\
\
So, I hope you find it useful and enjoy, and importantly, have fun!
